# Morphir Typescript Samples

This repository exists to show samples of the TypeScript output from morphir-elm

## Background

The morphir-elm project is able to take source code from various 'front end'
languages, and render it as an intermediate representation called Morphir, or
Morphir IR. Morphir IR output is saved in .json files, in JSON format.

The morphir-elm project also has multiple 'backends', which can read in the IR,
and output code written in other languages. A backend for TypeScript is
currently being developed. At time of writing, the TypeScript backend can
process (most of) the Types defined in a Morphir IR file, and output equivalent
TypeScript types. The values and functions may be implemented later.

Interestingly, the Morphir specification itself is written in elm, and can
therefore be rendered into Morphir IR, and the types can be transpiled into
TypeScript.

## This Repo

This repo contains sample outputs from the TypeScript backend. Most notably it
contains the defintions of Morphir Types, as transpiled into TypeScript.

This repo also contains handwritten Typescript code, which uses the TypeScript
types defined in the sample outputs. The purpose of this code is to test that
the autogenerated types are defined correctly, and can actually be used
successfully in code.
