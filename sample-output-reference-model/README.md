The typescript code in this folder was autogenerated by the TypeScript backend.

It was generated in the morphir-elm project from commit 22a019c. (currently the
head of branch `dwinship/Typescript-Backend-/Top-level-namespace`).

This code can be generated using the following commands:

```
# compile the morphir-elm cli application
npm run build --if-present

# navigate to the reference model directory
cd tests-integration/reference-model

# make the morphir-ir.json file, respresenting the Morphir-IR types
node  ../../cli/morphir-elm.js make --types-only 

# generate the typescript versions of those types, 
node  ../../cli/morphir-elm.js gen --target=TypeScript --output ./sample-output-reference-model

```
